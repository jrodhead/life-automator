What are you really thinking about just now?
What context would look right?
What is the reality of the situation?
What is the simplest solution?

What to increase? What to reduce? What to maintain?
What wouldn't you do?
What would your closest friend do?
When is it for?
Where is the edge?
Which parts can be grouped?

Would anyone want it?
You are an engineer
You can only make one dot at a time
